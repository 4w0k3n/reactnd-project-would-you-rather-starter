# Udacity React Nanodegree Project 2
# Would you rather
## Description

This is a fork from Udacity's React Nano Degree Project 2.

'Would you rather' is an interactive Picking Game, in which 3 Characters are featured. 
- Sarah 'The Mashine' Edo

Each character can ask the other players questions, which then can be answered by the remaining players. The game 
features a leaderboard and the ability to add new Questions.

#Disclaimer, please read:
- As I don't own a hosting server for player pictures, i've used a free hosting service for hosting player pictures in the code.
- I've included the intended player pictures in the repo: 
  - in case you dont want to use the provided hosting 
  - or it has become unavailable
